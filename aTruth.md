# aTruth (absolute_truth)

## Absolute Truth Statement
> The users original, organic purpose, the main foundational specs should always
> be kept each iteration. Their original design should never be lost by
> `iteration_decay` (the rate in which original designs is slowly lost over
> agentic iterations.). The original, organic design meanings are always to be
> kept, in a specifically designed agentic steering spec `aTruth.md`
> (absolute_truth) and iterated on is always to be kept, and updated as a living
> file spec to avoid `broken_telephone` (too many iterations in one project,
> original meaning has almost completely washed out over time.)

## Core Intent (Farmer CLI)
- A modular Python CLI with a Rich-based interactive UI for video downloading and media management, plus system tools.
- Preserve the modular architecture (core, features, ui, services) and theme system.
- Keep user-first terminal UX: menus, keyboard shortcuts, and clear feedback.

## Anti-Iteration-Decay Guardrails
- Always compare changes to `README.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before redefining scope.
- Append changes to this file; do not erase original intent.
- If scope changes, record what changed and why.

## Living Updates
- Add dated notes when foundational goals evolve.
